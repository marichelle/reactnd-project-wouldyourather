# Middleware

All middleware follows this currying pattern:

```
const logger = (store) => (next) => (action) => {
 // ...
}
```

The variable `logger` is assigned to a function that takes the `store` as its argument. That function returns another function, which is passed `next` (which is the next middleware in line or the dispatch function). That other function return another function which is passed an `action`. Once inside that third function, we have access to `store`, `next`, and `action`.

Itâ€™s important to note that the value of the `next` parameter will be determined by the `applyMiddleware` function. Why? All middleware will be called in the order it is listed in that function. In our case, the `next` will be `dispatch` because `logger` is the last middleware listed in that function.
